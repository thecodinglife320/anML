## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (latest version recommended)
- Android device or emulator running Android 6.0 (API 23) or higher
- [ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) dependencies
- [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax) dependencies

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thecodinglife320/anML.git
   ```
2. **Open in Android Studio:**  
   Open the project directory with Android Studio.

3. **Build the project:**  
   Let Gradle sync and download dependencies.  
   Run the app on your device or emulator.

### Usage

- Launch the app and explore the ML-powered camera features:
  - **Handwriting Recognition**: Draw handwritten text on the drawing surface for recognition.
  - **Face Detection**: Detect faces in images.
  - **Object Detection**: Identify objects using your device’s camera.
- Instructions for each feature can be found within the app interface.
